                                      toInt(phase == 'Running') \n evaluatePercentage(a,
                                      b) returns the value of (a * b%) example: evaluatePercentage(replicas,

                                      returns the memory size in byte example: calculateMemory(memory),
                                      for memory value 1 ki, it will return 1024 \n
