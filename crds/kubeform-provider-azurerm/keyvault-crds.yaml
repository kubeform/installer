                                      toInt(phase == 'Running') \n evaluatePercentage(a,
                                      b) returns the value of (a * b%) example: evaluatePercentage(replicas,
                                      maxUnavailable) \n calculateCPU() returns the
                                      cpu in unit core example: calculateCPU(cpu),
                                      for cpu value 150m, it will return 0.15 \n calculateMemory()
                                      returns the memory size in byte example: calculateMemory(memory),
                                      for memory value 1 ki, it will return 1024 \n
                                      toUnix() returns the DateTime string into unix
                                      format. example: toUnix(dateTime) will return
                                      the corresponding unix value for the given dateTime
                                      \n in above examples phase, replicas, maxUnavailable,
                                      cpu, memory, dateTime are Parameter's key those
                                      values will come from corresponding Parameter's
                                      value"
