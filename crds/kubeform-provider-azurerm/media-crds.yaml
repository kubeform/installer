                                      b) returns the value of (a * b%) example: evaluatePercentage(replicas,
                                      maxUnavailable) \n calculateCPU() returns the
                                      cpu in unit core example: calculateCPU(cpu),

                                      for memory value 1 ki, it will return 1024 \n
                                      toUnix() returns the DateTime string into unix
