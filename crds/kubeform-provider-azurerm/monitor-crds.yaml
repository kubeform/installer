                        important.

                                      some information of the object is collected
                                      as labels but there is no specific metric value.
                                      \n Example: For metrics \"kube_pod_info\", there
                                      are some information like host_ip, pod_ip, node

                                      a metric value, metric value is kept as 1. The
                                      metric will look like `kube_pod_info{host_ip=\"172.18.0.2\",

                                      toInt(phase == 'Running') \n evaluatePercentage(a,
                                      b) returns the value of (a * b%) example: evaluatePercentage(replicas,
                                      maxUnavailable) \n calculateCPU() returns the
                                      cpu in unit core example: calculateCPU(cpu),
                                      for cpu value 150m, it will return 0.15 \n calculateMemory()
                                      returns the memory size in byte example: calculateMemory(memory),
                                      for memory value 1 ki, it will return 1024 \n
                                      toUnix() returns the DateTime string into unix
                                      format. example: toUnix(dateTime) will return
                                      the corresponding unix value for the given dateTime
                                      \n in above examples phase, replicas, maxUnavailable,
