                                      some information of the object is collected
                                      as labels but there is no specific metric value.
                                      \n Example: For metrics \"kube_pod_info\", there
                                      are some information like host_ip, pod_ip, node
                                      name is collected as labels. As there must be
                                      a metric value, metric value is kept as 1. The
                                      metric will look like `kube_pod_info{host_ip=\"172.18.0.2\",
                                      pod_ip=\"10.244.0.14\", node=\"kind-control-plane\"
                                      .....}  1`"

                                      evaluation functions are: \n toInt() returns
                                      1 if the expression is true otherwise 0, example:
                                      toInt(phase == 'Running') \n evaluatePercentage(a,
                                      b) returns the value of (a * b%) example: evaluatePercentage(replicas,
                                      maxUnavailable) \n calculateCPU() returns the
                                      cpu in unit core example: calculateCPU(cpu),
                                      for cpu value 150m, it will return 0.15 \n calculateMemory()
                                      returns the memory size in byte example: calculateMemory(memory),
                                      for memory value 1 ki, it will return 1024 \n
                                      toUnix() returns the DateTime string into unix
                                      format. example: toUnix(dateTime) will return
                                      the corresponding unix value for the given dateTime
                                      \n in above examples phase, replicas, maxUnavailable,
                                      cpu, memory, dateTime are Parameter's key those
                                      values will come from corresponding Parameter's

                                      For metrics \"kube_deployment_spec_replicas\",
                                      the metricValue is coming from a specific path

                                      .spec.replicas Some example of json path: .metadata.observedGeneration,
