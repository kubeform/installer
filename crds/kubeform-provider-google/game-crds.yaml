                                      1 if the expression is true otherwise 0, example:
                                      toInt(phase == 'Running') \n evaluatePercentage(a,
                                      b) returns the value of (a * b%) example: evaluatePercentage(replicas,
                                      maxUnavailable) \n calculateCPU() returns the
                                      cpu in unit core example: calculateCPU(cpu),
                                      for cpu value 150m, it will return 0.15 \n calculateMemory()
                                      returns the memory size in byte example: calculateMemory(memory),
                                      for memory value 1 ki, it will return 1024 \n
                                      toUnix() returns the DateTime string into unix
                                      format. example: toUnix(dateTime) will return
                                      the corresponding unix value for the given dateTime
                                      \n in above examples phase, replicas, maxUnavailable,
                                      cpu, memory, dateTime are Parameter's key those
                                      values will come from corresponding Parameter's
