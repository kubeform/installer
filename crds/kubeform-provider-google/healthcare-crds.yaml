                  a new config is added, the next resource mutation is streamed to
                  the new location in addition to the existing ones. When a location
                  is removed from the list, the server stops streaming to that location.
                  Before adding a new config, you must add the required bigquery.dataEditor
                  role to your project's Cloud Healthcare Service Agent service account.
                  Some lag (typically on the order of dozens of seconds) is expected
                  before the results show up in the streaming destination.

                        The output is organized in one table per resource type. The
                        server reuses the existing tables (if any) that are named
                        after the resource types, e.g. "Patient", "Observation". When
                        there is no existing table for a given resource type, the
                        server attempts to create one. See the [streaming config reference](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/reference/rest/v1beta1/projects.locations.datasets.fhirStores#streamconfig)

                            core example: calculateCPU(cpu), for cpu value 150m, it
                            will return 0.15 \n calculateMemory() returns the memory

                            will return the corresponding unix value for the given
                            dateTime \n in above examples phase, replicas, maxUnavailable,
