                                      path of the manifest file of a object. ValueFromPath
                                      is used when the metric value is coming from
                                      any specific json path of the object. \n Example:
                                      For metrics \"kube_deployment_spec_replicas\",
                                      the metricValue is coming from a specific path
                                      .spec.replicas In this case, valueFromPath:
                                      .spec.replicas Some example of json path: .metadata.observedGeneration,
                                      .spec.restartPolicy, .status.startTime \n Some
                                      example of json path which is coming from an
                                      element of an array: .spec.containers[*].image,
                                      .status.containerStatuses[*].restartCount"
